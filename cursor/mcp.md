# Cursor MCP Integration Guide

Based on my experience integrating various services with Cursor through MCP, here's a practical guide on setting up and using MCP effectively.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a powerful feature in Cursor that enables direct integration with various services like GitHub, PostgreSQL, and Notion. It allows you to interact with these services directly from your IDE through natural language commands.

## Setting Up MCP

### Basic Configuration
1. Create a `.cursor` directory in your project root
2. Add an `mcp.json` file with your configuration
3. Structure your configuration based on the services you need

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}",
        "GITHUB_API_URL": "${GITHUB_API_URL}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

From my experience, here are critical security aspects to consider:

1. Token Management
   - Never commit tokens directly in configuration files
   - Use environment variables
   - Regularly rotate access tokens
   - Set appropriate token permissions

2. Access Control
   - For GitHub: Be careful with repository-level permissions
   - For databases: Use read-only access when possible
   - Consider creating service-specific accounts

3. Common Pitfalls
   - Unprotected main branches can be dangerous with automated merges
   - Unrestricted API tokens can be risky
   - CI/CD pipeline triggers need careful consideration

## Real-World Usage

Here are some practical examples from my daily workflow:

1. GitHub Integration
   - Creating and managing issues
   - Reviewing pull requests
   - Managing repositories
   - Code search and navigation

2. Database Operations
   - Running queries
   - Schema management
   - Data exploration

3. Documentation (Notion)
   - Creating and updating documentation
   - Managing knowledge bases
   - Team collaboration

## Best Practices

Based on my experience:

1. Development Workflow
   - Always review generated code before committing
   - Keep MCP configurations separate for different environments
   - Document your MCP setup for team reference

2. Error Handling
   - Monitor MCP server logs
   - Set up proper error notifications
   - Have fallback procedures for critical operations

3. Team Collaboration
   - Share best practices with team members
   - Maintain consistent MCP configurations across team
   - Document common use cases and solutions

## Troubleshooting

Common issues I've encountered and their solutions:

1. Connection Issues
   - Check environment variables
   - Verify network access
   - Confirm service status

2. Permission Problems
   - Review token scopes
   - Check service-specific permissions
   - Verify account access levels

3. Configuration Errors
   - Validate JSON syntax
   - Confirm environment variable names
   - Check service endpoints
