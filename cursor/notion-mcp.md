# Notion MCP Integration Guide

After integrating Notion with Cursor through MCP, I've found it incredibly useful for managing documentation and notes directly from the IDE. Here's my practical guide based on real usage.

## Setting Up Notion MCP

The setup process is straightforward but requires careful attention to authentication:

1. Install the Notion MCP Server
```bash
npm install -g @notionhq/notion-mcp-server
```

2. Configure MCP in `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notionApi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS": "{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer your-notion-token\", \"Notion-Version\": \"2022-06-28\" }"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Get Your Notion Token:
   - Go to Notion's settings
   - Navigate to Integrations
   - Create a new integration
   - Copy the token
   - Share your pages with the integration

## Practical Uses

Here's how I use Notion MCP daily:

1. Documentation Management
   - Create new pages for features
   - Update existing documentation
   - Organize project notes

2. Content Creation
   - Write blog posts
   - Create technical guides
   - Maintain team documentation

3. Project Management
   - Track tasks and issues
   - Maintain meeting notes
   - Document decisions

## Best Practices

From my experience:

1. Content Organization
   - Use consistent page structures
   - Maintain clear hierarchies
   - Tag content appropriately

2. Version Control
   - Keep documentation in sync with code
   - Document major changes
   - Use dated entries when needed

3. Team Collaboration
   - Share templates
   - Establish naming conventions
   - Define update procedures

## Security Considerations

Important security aspects I've learned:

1. Token Management
   - Never commit tokens to version control
   - Use environment variables
   - Regularly rotate integration tokens

2. Access Control
   - Grant minimum required permissions
   - Regularly audit page sharing
   - Remove unused integrations

3. Content Protection
   - Back up important content
   - Control page sharing carefully
   - Monitor integration activity

## Common Operations

Here are some operations I frequently use:

1. Page Management
   - Create new pages
   - Update existing content
   - Organize information

2. Database Operations
   - Query Notion databases
   - Update records
   - Track changes

3. Content Search
   - Find specific pages
   - Search within content
   - Filter by properties

## Troubleshooting

Common issues I've encountered:

1. Authentication Problems
   - Check token validity
   - Verify page permissions
   - Confirm integration access

2. Rate Limiting
   - Handle API limits gracefully
   - Implement request spacing
   - Use batch operations

3. Content Sync Issues
   - Verify page IDs
   - Check content format
   - Confirm update permissions

## Tips for Effective Use

Based on my daily workflow:

1. Content Structure
   - Use clear headings
   - Maintain consistent formatting
   - Include metadata when useful

2. Integration Workflow
   - Test changes on draft pages
   - Use templates for consistency
   - Keep content organized

3. Performance
   - Cache frequently used content
   - Batch similar operations
   - Monitor API usage

Remember to always test new integrations on non-critical pages first!
