# GenAI IDE Guide

As a developer who has extensively worked with various AI-powered IDEs, I wanted to share my experiences and learnings. This guide aims to help other developers navigate the world of GenAI-powered development environments, focusing on practical usage, security considerations, and real-world examples.

## Why This Guide?

After spending considerable time working with different AI-powered IDEs, I've learned that while these tools are powerful, they need to be used thoughtfully. This guide shares practical insights from real development experiences, including both successes and pitfalls to avoid.
